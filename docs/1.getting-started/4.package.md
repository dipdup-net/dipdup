# Project package

Each DipDup project consists of a YAML config and a Python package of a specific structure. It could be placed anywhere, but needs to be importable. The package name is defined in the config file.

To generate all necessary directories and files according to config run the `init` command. You should run it every time you significantly change the config file.

The structure of the resulting package is the following:

| Path                          | Description                                                                                                                          |

| :file_folder: `hooks`         | User-defined callbacks to run manually or by schedule                                                                                |

| `{{ project.package }}  -> .` | A little helper, symlink to let you import the package from the root directory.                                                      |
| `pyproject.toml`              | Python package metadata (introduced in PEP 518; see [details](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/)) |
| `Makefile`                    | Makefile with shortcuts for common commands (run `make` for help)                                                                    |

Also, there are `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore` files and `py.typed` marker ([PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)). Usually, you won't need to modify them.

## ABIs and typeclasses

DipDup uses contract type information to generate [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models to work with strictly typed data. We call these models _typeclasses_. Modules in the `types` directory are generated automatically from contract ABIs and JSONSchemas during init. You can modify them manually, but usually won't need to. Under the hood, the process is roughly the following:

1. Contract ABIs are fetched from public sources or provided by the user.
2. DipDup converts these ABIs to intermediate JSONSchemas.
3. JSONSchemas converted to Pydantic models with [datamodel-code-generator](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/datamodel_code_generator/).

This approach allows working with complex contract types with nested structures and polymorphic variants.

## Config snippets

`config/` directory contains environment-specific config snippets. They don't contain `package`/`spec_version` fields and can be used to extend/override the root config. See [Merging config files](../1.getting-started/3.config.md#merging-multiple-files) for details.

### Replay file

`config/replay.yaml` is a special file that contains options used during generation a new project. You can use it to create a new project with the same settings, or modify it to change chosen options.

## Dev tools

The `Makefile` contains shortcuts for all commands you might need during development! Run `make` without arguments to see the list of available commands:

```text

  ðŸš§ DipDup developer tools

help:            Show this help (default)
all:             Run an entire CI pipeline

install:         Install dependencies
update:          Update dependencies
format:          Format with all tools
lint:            Lint with all tools

black:           Format with black
ruff:            Lint with ruff
mypy:            Lint with mypy

image:           Build Docker image
up:              Start Compose stack
down:            Stop Compose stack
```

See the file contents for details. Feel free to modify it to fit your workflow!

## Deploy recipes

The `deploy` directory contains:

- `Dockerfile`, a recipe to build a Docker image with your project. Usually, you won't need to modify it. See comments inside for details.
- Compose files to run your project locally or in the cloud.
- Default env variables for each environment. See [Environment variables](../1.getting-started/3.config.md#environment-variables) for details.

## Nested packages

Callbacks can be grouped into packages to organize the project structure. Add one or multiple dots to the callback name to define nested packages:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
package: {{ project.package }}
hooks:
  backup.restore:
    callback: backup.on_restore
```

After running the `init` command, you'll get the following directory tree (shortened for brevity)

```text
{{ project.package }}
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backup
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ on_restore.py
â””â”€â”€ sql
    â””â”€â”€ backup
        â””â”€â”€ on_restore
```

Handler callbacks can be grouped the same way. Note, that the callback name still needs to be a valid Python module path: _only lowercase letters, underscores, and dots_.
