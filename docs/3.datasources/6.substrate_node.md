# Substrate node

DipDup can connect to any Substrate node via JSON-RPC. It can be used as a "last mile" datasource for Substrate indexes (data that is not in Subsquid Network yet) or as a standalone datasource for handlers and hooks.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
{{ #include ../src/demo_substrate_events/dipdup.yaml:11:15 }}
```

Then, add it to EVM index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_substrate_events/dipdup.yaml:22: }}
```
