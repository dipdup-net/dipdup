# Subscan

[Subscan](https://subscan.io/) is a popular Substrate blockchain explorer. It provides a public API to fetch Substrate metadata. DipDup can use its API to fetch ABIs for pallets being indexed.

To use this datasource, add the following section in config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  subscan:
    kind: substrate.subscan
    url: ${ETHERSCAN_URL:-https://api.subscan.io/api}
    api_key: ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY:-''}
```

During initialization, DipDup will use this datasource to fetch contract ABIs. If your config contains definitions for multiple networks, you can assign the datasource explicitly in `substrate.subsquid` index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  substrate_events:
    kind: substrate.events
    datasources:
    - subscan
    ...
```
