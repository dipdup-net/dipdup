# Subsquid Network

DipDup uses [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network/reference/evm-api/) as a source of historical data for Substrate blockchains.

Configure the datasource in your project config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_substrate_events/dipdup.yaml:3:7 }}
```

Then, add it to Substrate index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_substrate_events/dipdup.yaml:22: }}
```

DipDup will use Subsquid Network when possible and fallback to EVM nodes for the latest data and realtime updates.
