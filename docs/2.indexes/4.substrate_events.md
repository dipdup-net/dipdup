# `substrate.events` index

This index allows processing events emitted by Substrate pallets. You can define a handler for each module/name pair. Only necessary events are processed.

Below is a basic indexer for AssetHub transfers.

To create a project based on this template, run `dipdup new -t demo_substrate_events`.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_substrate_events/dipdup.yaml }}
```

{{ #include 2.indexes/_substrate.md }}
