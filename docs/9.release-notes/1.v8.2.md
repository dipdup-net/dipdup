# Release Notes: 8.2

Today we are glad to present you DipDup 8.2. This release is all about one thing: indexing Substrate networks.

If you're new to DipDup and want action, follow the [Substrate Quickstart Guide](../0.quickstart-substrate.md)!

If you're familiar with DipDup, the process is very similar to indexing EVM and Starknet networks. Run the `dipdup new` command to initialize the project interactively, update the with your URLs/variables/addresses (in this case, pallets) to index, run `dipdup init`, and you're good to go.

We support three sources of Substrate data. Squid Network provides all kinds of historical data in a very efficient format. For the blocks yet to be processed by Squid Network you can use Substrate node RPC. Indexing with node RPC is much slower, but allows to process blocks as soon as they are announced. Finally, an optional Subscan API connector is used to speed up the project initialization.

This release is a pretty big milestone for us, but we decided to make it a minor one, since we follow the semantic versioning, and 8.2 doesn't introduce any changes that break backward compatibility. So, you can extend your existing projects with Substrate data right after the update. A if you're still on 7.x branch, it's a pretty good time for us to remind you to upgrade! :)
