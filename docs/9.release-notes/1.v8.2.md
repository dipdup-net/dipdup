# Release Notes: 8.2

We're excited to present DipDup 8.2! This release brings several notable improvements:

- New: Substrate network event indexing
- Starknet enhancements
- `uv` package manager support
- Various bug fixes

While this release marks a significant milestone for us, we've kept it as a minor version since it maintains full backward compatibility. You can start working with Substrate data in your existing projects right after updating.

## Indexing Substrate events

New to DipDup and ready to dive in? Check out our [Substrate Quickstart Guide](../0.quickstart-substrate.md)!

If you're familiar with DipDup, the process will feel familiar - it's similar to working with EVM and Starknet networks. Just run `dipdup new` for interactive project setup, configure your URLs/variables/addresses (pallets in this case), execute `dipdup init`, and you're all set.

We now support three Substrate data sources:

- **Squid Network** (formerly Subsquid) delivers compressed historical data (fast, but with a delay)
- **Substrate node RPC** handles the latest and real-time blocks (slower but immediate)
- Optional **Subscan API** connector speeds up project initialization

## Starknet improvements

Our Starknet support keeps getting better. Now you can fetch contract ABIs directly from the Starknet node instead of putting them into the project manually (requires `starknet.node` datasource configured). Plus, all complex Starknet types now parsed correctly.

## `uv` support

Starting thom this release, DipDup defaults to [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for new projects, a powerful and [extremely fast](https://lincolnloop.github.io/python-package-manager-shootout/) package manager for Python.

We're also planning to adopt `uv` as `pipx` replacement for standalone installations (installer script and `dipdup self` commands).

## 7.5 branch EOL

DipDup 7.5, our previous major release, has reached end-of-life. We recommend upgrading to the latest version to access new features and bug fixes.

Going forward, we'll focus on supporting only the latest major version to reduce maintenance overhead. Any breaking changes will be introduced gradually and can be enabled using the `DIPDUP_NEXT` environment variable.
